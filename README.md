1. Implementing a Pushdown Automaton
 
You are to implement the functionality which will allow the simulation of pushdown automata. Pushdown automata should have the following type:
 
type PDA = (Int,[Int],[Transition])
 
where the Int gives the start state, the [Int] gives the accepting states, and the [Transitions] gives the transitions of the pushdown automaton.
 
The transitions of the pushdown automaton should have the following type:
 
type Transition = ((Int,String,String),(Int,String))
 
where in the first tuple (Int,String,String, the Int gives the current state, the first String gives the next character of the input (or the empty string if the transition does not consume the next character of the input), and the second String gives the character at the top of the stack (or the empty string if the transition does not pop the top character off the stack). In the second tuple of a transition (Int,String), the Int gives the new state and the String gives the new character to be pushed on to the top of the stack (or the empty string if no character is pushed).
 
Configurations of a pushdown automaton should have the following type:
 
type Configuration = (Int,String,String)
 
where the Int is the current state (this should be the initial state for the starting configuration), the first String is the remaining input (this should be the initial input for the starting configuration), and the second String is the contents of the stack (this should be the empty string for the starting configuration). 
 
The result produced by a pushdown automaton should have the following type:
 
data Result = Accept | Reject deriving Show
 
This indicates whether or not the initial input string is accepted or rejected by the pushdown automaton.
 
You are to implement a function run which simulates the execution of a pushdown automaton and has the following type:
 
run :: PDA -> String -> Result
 
where the PDA gives the definition of the pushdown automaton, the String gives the input string, and the Result gives the result of running the pushdown automaton on the input string.
 
You should bear in mind that pushdown automata are non-deterministic in general, so they may have a number of different possible configurations at each step of execution. Your simulation should therefore keep track of all the possible configurations of the pushdown automaton at each step. The possible configurations at the next step will therefore be the result of a single transition from each of the possible configurations at the previous step. 
 
Your simulation should return the result Accept if any of the current possible configurations of the pushdown automaton correspond to an accepting state, an empty input and an empty stack. Otherwise, your simulation should return the result Reject if there are no transitions from any of the current possible configurations.
 
To test your pushdown automaton simulation, try out the pushdown automaton which accepts the language {w ∈ {a,b}*|w=wR}. This pushdown automaton is defined as follows:
 
pal = (1,[2],[((1,"a",""),(1,"a")),
              ((1,"b",""),(1,"b")),
              ((1,"a",""),(2,"")),
              ((1,"b",""),(2,"")),
              ((1,"",""),(2,"")),
              ((2,"a","a"),(2,"")),
              ((2,"b","b"),(2,""))])
 
You should obtain the following results when running this pushdown automaton:
 
> run pal "abbabba"
 
Accept
 
> run pal "abaaba"
 
Accept 
 
> run pal ""
 
Accept
 
> run pal "ab"
 
Reject
 
> run pal "abaabba"
 
Reject


2. Designing Your Own Pushdown Automaton
 
Design a pushdown automaton ijk to accept the language {aibjck | i,j,k ≥ 0 and i=j or i=k}. This pushdown automaton should accept the following strings:
 
""
"b"
"abbc"
"aabbc"
"aabbcc"
 
And reject the following strings:
 
"a"
"aabc"
"abbcc"


3. Designing Another Pushdown Automaton
 
Design a pushdown automaton abc to accept the language {w ∈ {a,b,c}* | the number of c's is equal to the number of a's plus the number of b's}. This pushdown automaton should accept the following strings:
 
""
"cabc"
"cacbca"
"aabbcccc"
"acbcbcac"
 
And reject the following strings:
 
"a"
"abc"
"cacbcac"
